# Building the AIRE Framework

This repo is the companion repo for the Building the AIRE Framework livestream series.

In this series, we'll build a complete AI Reliability Engineering (AIRE) framework from the ground up. We'll show you how to transform traditional automation into context-aware AI agents that understand your systems, follow best practices, and work alongside human engineers to enhance reliability.
Throughout this series, we'll progressively develop AI agents that generate Terraform configurations, integrate with GitHub for version control, and validate AWS resource deployments—creating a full-circle AIRE system. Whether you're an SRE looking to reduce alert fatigue or a platform engineer interested in more resilient systems, this series will show you practical ways to implement AIRE principles that make both your infrastructure and your team more dependable.

## Part 1: Building a Terraform AI Agent

In the first session of the AIRE Framework series, we'll build a Terraform AI agent using kagent and MCP.
Join us as we:
- Introduce the concept of AI Reliability Engineering and how it differs from traditional automation
- Create and refine agent instructions in real-time to generate Terraform configurations
- Integrate with the AWS Labs Terraform MCP server to ensure adherence to infrastructure best practices
